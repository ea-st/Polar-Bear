## Polar Bear 🐻‍❄️

The modern web is *very* slow.  
Full of *trackers*, *ads*, and *unnecessary features* that only take away from usability.  
Many sites [***aren't built with forethought***](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) and end up breaking because of broken dependencies or neglect due to difficult maintenance.  
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) creates a nice middleground allowing for easy maintenance and content addition    
without having to do everything in HTML and CSS.

[*Polar Bear*](https://codeberg.org/east/Polar-Bear) is a fork of the [*Hugo Bear Blog*](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) *theme*.  
 I created this to give my own spin on the already excellent theme *(for fun)*.
